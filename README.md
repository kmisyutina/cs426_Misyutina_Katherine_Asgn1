This project follows the theme "What home means to you".

My assignment is inspired by the home that I've lived in for the past 12 years.
When we moved to our home in 2008, we had a beautiful white birch tree that got sick and
began to split a few years later. Our front yard was bare for a few years, until my 
family found a place that sold birch saplings! Now we have 4 beautiful young birches in
our home.
2 years ago, my dad and my younger brother built a wooden bench that still sits
in my front yard, which is why there are wooden benches throughout the
environment.
The BB-8 character shoots out apples not just because its an easy asset to find
(although... it's that too), but because my childhood is filled with memories of both
of my grandmas and my Russian babysitter always bringing me an apple in the
afternoon.
